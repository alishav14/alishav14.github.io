    <h1>Engineering Accomplishments</h1>
    <div class="project">
      <h2>DigiDoc</h2>
      <p class="project-details">
        A patient-doctor interaction program using an app and integrated sensor system; <span class="highlight">won 1st
          place</span> in MakeSPP Hackathon; currently planning to apply for a patent on the idea. This program
        exemplifies how technology can improve access for the elderly and disabled, especially during the pandemic.
      </p>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>Life Below Water</h2>
      <p class="project-details">
        An ocean pollution awareness website coded with HTML, CSS, & JS; <span class="highlight">won in Microsoft
          Hackathon</span> for contributing to a UN Sustainability Goal. This project demonstrated how technology can
        raise awareness and knowledge about societal issues.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>AI Discrimination Research</h2>
      <p class="project-details">
        Research project analyzing and correcting AI discrimination in speech recognition software using Python; had the
        opportunity to <span class="highlight">present my research</span> to scientists and researchers from leading
        research institutions. This project highlighted the often-overlooked importance of bias in technology.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>Street Sweeper Prototype</h2>
      <p class="project-details">
        Created and tested a prototype street sweeper with an integrated electromagnet system to overcome the challenge
        of cleaning metals off the road; <span class="highlight">awarded medal</span> for successful Electrical and
        Mechanical Engineering project in Hudson County STEM showcase. Learned how engineering can make street cleaning
        more efficient and prevent flat tires.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>Electrons from Anaerobic Bacteria</h2>
      <p class="project-details">
        Created a prototype measuring electrons generated from anaerobic bacteria to produce electricity using a fuel
        cell powered by wastewater; <span class="highlight">awarded medal</span> for a successful Environmental
        Management project in Hudson County STEM
        showcase. This project taught me how engineering can be applied to create sustainable energy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>Solar Energy-Powered Water Pump</h2>
      <p class="project-details">
        Developed a prototype for a solar energy-powered water pump aimed at reducing ocean acidification and global
        warming effects on density-varied water; presented in Hudson County STEM showcase. Learned how to lower ocean
        temperature and reduce carbon dioxide interaction with sea life.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>Microbial Fuel Cell Electricity</h2>
      <p class="project-details">
        Created a prototype generating electricity using a naturally-made microbial fuel cell with bacteria in various
        benthic samples; <span class="highlight">awarded medal </span>in the Environmental Engineering category in
        Hudson County STEM showcase.
